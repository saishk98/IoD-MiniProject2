        "Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, known in the Gotham City Underworld as The Penguin, is a brutal and sadistic crime lord, who funded criminal operations as one of its biggest black-market manufactures. Originally directing his affairs from a dilapidated ship, the Final Offer, and later operating via the famous Iceberg Lounge nightclub, Oswald was viewed by the public eye as a legitimate businessman to the people of Gotham, but in reality, he is a sadistic, mass murdering gang leader.\n\n",
        "Cobblepot accumulated his power within Gotham City's criminal underworld and slowly built up his own forces to carve out a piece of the black market for his own profits and purposes. After he formed an alliance with Black Mask, the most powerful and sadistic crime lord in the entire city, the Penguin sought to cripple his competition, particularly the Falcone Crime Family and aid in killing the Dark Knight in order to consolidate his own power over the city."

Batman had proven to be a worthy opponent, capable of deducing the Riddler's plans, but Nigma was still dedicated to creating a mystery that would stump even the Dark Knight, even if he had to kill someone to do so.\n\n",

The desire to prove himself better than Batman had finally consumed him. This eventually drove him to ensure the Dark Knight didn't have a chance of winning, by eliminating any fair play."
